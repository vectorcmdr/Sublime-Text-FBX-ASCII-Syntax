# Sublime-Text-FBX-ASCII-Syntax
Basic syntax support file for FBX (ASCII format) files in Sublime Text.

<br>

Add the ``FBX_ASCII.sublime-syntax`` file to ``%appdata%/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User``.

It will now load for .fbx files from now on, if Sublime is being goofy you will need to select it from the Syntax menu.
