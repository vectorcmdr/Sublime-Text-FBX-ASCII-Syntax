# Sublime-Text-FBX-ASCII-Syntax
Basic syntax support file for FBX (ASCII format) files in Sublime Text.

<br>

Add the ``FBX_ASCII.sublime-syntax`` file to ``%appdata%/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User``.

It will now load for .fbx files from now on.

If your file is currently open at the time of adding the file, simply select the syntax for that session. It defaults to it after that.
